# Cryptographic-SHA256-Preimage-Recovery
Empirical validation of SHA-256 preimage recovery using GCIS neural architecture. 100% bit-sign pattern matching across 5 independent password reconstructions (20-32 chars). Includes raw layer data, analysis scripts, and full methodology. Open challenge for cryptanalysts: blind search &amp; sequencing.
